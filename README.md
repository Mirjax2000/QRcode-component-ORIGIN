# QRcode-component-ORIGIN

<h2>Challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges</h2>

Challenge was too easy, to put screen of QR code to the middle of frame<br>
so i made it more challenging and made it functional.
If you click GENERATE link, it will generate random QR code.
Lenght of the code is 10 random letters.
